I am a graduate student instructor (GSI) at the University of Michigan. As such, I have taught, co-coordinated, or been a TA for various undergraduate mathematics courses, from introductory calculus to differential equations. Please see below for a summary of my past teaching experiences.

Math 116 Co-coordination
======
In Fall 2022, I was the student co-coordinator for Math 116, U of M's introductory Calculus II course. 


Math 216 (Differential Equations)
======
In Winter 2021, I was a lab instructor for a course in applied differential equations. The lab component of this course featured weekly lab meetings where students worked on applied projects coded in MATLAB.


Math 116 (Calculus II)
======
Semesters taught: Winter 2020, Fall 2020

Math 116 is the second course in U of M's standard introductory calculus sequence. Classes are typically 15-20 students and involve a mix of lecturing and groupwork. 


Math 115 (Calculus I)
======
Semesters taught: Fall 2019

Math 115 is the first course in U of M's standard introductory calculus sequence. Classes are typically 15-20 students and involve a mix of lecturing and groupwork.
