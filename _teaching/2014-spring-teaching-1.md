I am a graduate student instructor (GSI) at the University of Michigan. As such, I have TA'd or taught for various mathematics courses. Please see the list below.

Math 216 (Differential Equations)
======
In Winter 2021, I was a lab instructor for a course in applied differential equations. The lab component of this course featured weekly lab meetings where students worked on applied projects coded in MATLAB.


Math 116 (Calculus II)
======
Semesters taught: Winter 2020, Fall 2020

Math 116 is the second course in U of M's standard introductory calculus sequence. Classes are typically 15-20 students and involve a mix of lecturing and groupwork. 


Math 115 (Calculus I)
