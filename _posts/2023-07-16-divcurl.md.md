Let $M$ be a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Riemannian metric $g$. Let $E = S^2 T^* M$ be the vector bundle of symmetric covariant 2-tensors on $M$, and let $F = T^* M \oplus S^2 T^* M$. We consider the linear differential operator $L : \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(F)$, where $\Gamma(B)$ denotes sections of a bundle $B$, defined by:
\begin{equation}
    L_1(k) = ({\text{div}} k, {\text{curl}} k)
\end{equation}
and also the related operator
\begin{equation}
    L_2(k) = ({\text{div}} k, \text{S}{\text{curl}} k). 
\end{equation}
Here, the curl of a symmetric 2-covariant tensor field is defined by:
\begin{align*}
  \text{curl}(k)_{lm} = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{lmj}.
\end{align*}
We use the (nonstandard) notation Scurl to denote the symmetrized curl, which is just the symmetrization of the curl. The symmetrization of a 2-covariant tensor $T_{ab}$ is
\begin{align*}
  ST_{ab} = T_{ab} + T_{ba}. 
\end{align*} 
(Note that many sources put a factor of 1/2 here.) We now investigate the principal symbols of these operators and discuss their ellipticity, i.e. when or if they have zero kernel. The principal symbol of the divergence operator in the direction $\xi \in T^*M$ is a linear map $\sigma_{{\text{div}}}(\xi) : E \to F$ defined by:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{{\text{div}}}(\xi)(k)_m = g^{ij}\xi_i k_{jm} = k_{jm}\xi^j
\end{equation}
and that of ${\text{curl}}$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{{\text{curl}}}(\xi)(k)_{lm} = \epsilon_{lij}\xi^i \tensor{k}{^j _m}.
\end{equation}
The principal symbol of Scurl is the symmetrization of the principal symbol of curl. Finally, note that 
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{L_1}(\xi)(k) = (\sigma_{{\text{div}}}(\xi)(k), \sigma_{{\text{curl}}}(\xi)(k))
\end{equation}
and similarly for $\sigma_{L_2}$.

First, we note that alone, neither div nor curl (nor Scurl) can be elliptic. 

\begin{proposition}
Let $\xi \neq 0$.
The kernels of $\sigma_{{\text{div}}}, \sigma_{{\text{curl}}}$, and $\sigma_{\text{Scurl}}$ are all nonzero.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For div: any $k$ which is nonzero, but is annihilated by $\xi$, is in the kernel. For instance, if $\theta \in \xi^\perp$, then setting $k = \theta \otimes \theta$ gives an element of the kernel.

For curl: this is somewhat of the opposite situation as div, since in this case the contraction is done by the volume form rather than the metric. Therefore one can pick $k$ which is in some sense ``colinear'' to $\xi$. In particular, setting $k = \xi \otimes \xi$ gives a nonzero kernel element. For Scurl it is similar.
\end{proof}

However, together, they form an elliptic operator, in the sense that $L_1, L_2$ have zero kernel for their principal symbols. 

\begin{proposition}
The principal symbol of $L_1$ has zero kernel.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\xi \neq 0$. Suppose that $\sigma_{L_1}(\xi)(k) = 0$. Choose a basis $\{e^1\}$ for the cotangent space at that point which is orthonormal and with $\xi = e^1$. (Since for $\lambda \in \R$ we have $\sigma_{L_1}(\lambda\xi)(k) = \lambda\sigma_{L_1}(\xi)(k)$, we can assume that $|\xi|_{g^{-1}} = 1$.) Then we have the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
    k_{1m} &= 0 \hspace{5mm} \forall m = 1, 2, 3 \\ 
    \epsilon_{lij}(e^1)^i \tensor{k}{^j _m} &= 0 \hspace{5mm} \forall l,m = 1, 2, 3.
\end{align*}
Since $k$ is symmetric, the only potentially-nonzero components are $k_{22}, k_{33}$, and $k_{23} = k_{32}$. One can immediately conclude that the LHS of the second equation is zero when $l = 1$ or $m = 1$. Otherwise, one obtains the equations:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{-1}{2}k_{23} &= 0 \hspace{5mm} \text{(when $l = m = 2$)} \\ 
    \frac{-1}{2}k_{33} &= 0 \hspace{5mm} \text{(when $l = 2, m = 3$)} \\ 
    \frac{1}{2}k_{22} &= 0 \hspace{5mm} \text{(when $l = 3, m = 2$)} \\ 
    \frac{1}{2}k_{23} &= 0 \hspace{5mm} \text{(when $l = m = 3$)}.
\end{align*}
These equations imply that all components of $k$ are zero. Therefore $\sigma_{L_1}$ has zero kernel.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
The principal symbol of $L_2$ in the direction $\xi$, $\sigma_{L_2}(\xi)$, does \emph{not} have zero kernel. In fact, its kernel is exactly the pure-trace 2-covariant symmetric tensors with underlying vector space $(\xi^\sharp)^\perp$, $\xi^\sharp$ denoting the vector in $TM$ which is metric-dual to $\xi$. In other words,
\begin{equation}
    \ker(\sigma_{L_2}(\xi)) = \{k \in E \ | \ k|_{(\xi^\sharp)^\perp} = \lambda g|_{(\xi^\sharp)^\perp} \ \text{for some} \ \lambda \in \R\}.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Performing the same strategy in the same type of basis as the previous proposition (and supposing without loss of generality that $|\xi|_{g^{-1}} = 1$, one arrives at the equations $k_{1m} = 0$ and $k_{23} = 0$, and 
\begin{align*}
    k_{22} = k_{33}.
\end{align*}
Thus the kernel of $\sigma_{L_2}(\xi)$ is all $k \in E$ which have, relative to the basis $\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$, has the matrix representation
\begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
    0 & \lambda & 0 \\ 
    0 & 0 & \lambda
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*}
i.e. $k = \lambda (e^2 \otimes e^2 + e^3 \otimes e^3)$. (The covector $e^i$ is the element of the \emph{linear} dual basis to $e_i$.) Since $e_i$ are an orthonormal basis, this completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
If $L_2$ is considered to act on sections of $E'$ rather than $E$, where $E'$ is the sub-bundle of $E$ consisting of trace-free symmetric 2-covariant tensors, then $\sigma_{L_2}$ has zero kernel.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Continue from the previous proposition's proof. So one has $k_{22} = k_{33}$ and $k_{ij} = 0$ for all other components. In particular $k_{11} = 0$, so $\tr(k) = k_{22} + k_{33}$. Since $k \in \Gamma(E')$ it must have zero trace and hence $k_{22} = -k_{33}$, thus $k_{22} = k_{33} = 0$ and hence $\sigma_{L_2} : E' \to F$ has zero kernel.
\end{proof}
