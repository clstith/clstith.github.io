Miscellaneous
======
- I've worked on data-related projects with local organizations through [CTAC](https://ginsberg.umich.edu/ctac) at the Ginsberg Center at U of M, such as: 
  - Data visualization of organizational collaboration for [MI-CEMI](https://michigancollaborative.org/)
  - Data visualization & mapping for [Brilliant Detroit](https://brilliantdetroit.org/) 
  - Data visualization & mapping for the Girl Scouts of Southeastern Michigan
  - Data analysis of survey responses for [OLHSA](https://www.olhsa.org/en-us/)
  - Python & Bash visualization tutorials for CTAC
- I've worked on a team project for the [Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) Data Science Bootcamp that used machine learning and data science methods to predict the direction of neutrinos from cosmic rays. Our project received a [Certificate of Completion with Distinction](../files/Erdos_Certificate_2023.pdf)
- Following the Data Science Bootcamp, I worked on a team project for the Erdos Institute's Deep Learning Bootcamp, where we used LLMs (specifically DeBERTa and RoBERTa) to identify personally identifying information (PII) in academic writing
