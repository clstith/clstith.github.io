### Michigan Climate & Weather Data Viz ([LINK](https://clstith.github.io/michigan-climate))

This is a project I did on visualizing and detecting climate change in weather data from 1900 until today. I scraped and cleaned data from the [NOAA API](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2) using Python. Currently tracking rainfall by county; other measurements are planned additions.
