I am a graduate student instructor (GSI) at the University of Michigan. As such, I have taught, co-coordinated, or been a TA for various undergraduate mathematics courses, from introductory calculus to differential equations. Please see below for a summary of my past teaching experiences.

<h1>Past teaching experience</h1>

<h3>Introductory Program Co-Coordination</h3>

<p>In Fall 2022, I was the student co-coordinator for Math 116 at U of M. This is the second course in U of M's introductory calculus sequence; co-coordination duties are on the administrative/logistical side of things, including writing exams and homework for the course.

<h3>Math 216 (Differential Equations)</h3>

<p>In Winter 2021, I was a lab instructor for a course in applied differential equations. The lab component of this course featured weekly lab meetings where students worked on applied projects coded in MATLAB.
</p>

<h3>Math 116 (Calculus II)</h3>

<p>Semesters taught: Winter 2020, Fall 2020</p>

<p>Math 116 is the second course in U of M's standard introductory calculus sequence. Classes are typically 15-20 students and involve a mix of lecturing and groupwork. 
</p>


<h3>Math 115 (Calculus I)</h3>

<p>Semesters taught: Fall 2019</p>

<p>Math 115 is the first course in U of M's standard introductory calculus sequence. Classes are typically 15-20 students and involve a mix of lecturing and groupwork.
