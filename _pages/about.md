I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan studying mathematical general relativity. My advisor is Lydia Bieri. 

I am also the co-chair of the Midwest Research Experience for Graduates (MREG), a two-week summer program hosted at the University of Michigan for early-stage graduate students in pure & applied mathematics.

### Research interests: 

- Mathematical general relativity
- Geometric analysis 
- Partial differential equations
