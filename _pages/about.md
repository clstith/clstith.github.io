I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan studying mathematical general relativity. My advisor is Lydia Bieri. 

### Research interests: 

- Mathematical general relativity (specifically singularity/trapped surface formation)
- Geometric analysis 
- Partial differential equations (specifically hyperbolic systems)

I was the co-chair of the Midwest Research Experience for Graduates ([MREG](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/mreg-2023/home)) 2023, a two-week summer program hosted at the University of Michigan for early-stage graduate students in pure & applied mathematics. We're currently in the process of designing a more sustainable funding model for future MREGs! 

Outside of mathematics, I work on data analysis and data visualization problems for local Michigan organizations through [CTAC](https://ginsberg.umich.edu/ctac).
